        <p>
            As for some intereseting personal tidbits about myself, I am from Canada and moved to the United States in the summer of 2015. After I graduated highschool I took a year off from school
            to go back to my hometown in Canada and play junior hockey. Currently my main hobby includes playing golf! I have included a photograph of me playing junior hockey along with one of me enjoying
            a round of golf with my family.
