        <p>
            Over the course of my studies thus far I there a few things that I have done that I am very proud of. The first and most notable would be when I along with my group, created an
            entire database for our ficticious company using SQL. We had to diagram the ERD, normalize the ERD, denormalize the ERD and then bring it to life with SQL along with populating it
            full of data. This is one of the most fulfilling things I have done in school, something that I truly enjoyed and helped me work on a skill that can be used in the real world.
