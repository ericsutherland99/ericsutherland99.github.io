        <p>
            Over the course of my studies at the University of Oklahoma I have learned some tangible programming skills. I feel very comfortable using SQL and coding with C#. I am continuing 
            to learn how to use HTML5 and CSS to create and design webpages and I have begun programming using Python in my spare time. Also I can code in VBA.. but I don't think that's as useful as the others.
